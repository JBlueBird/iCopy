**iCopy - Transfer your music with ease**


I built a macOS app called iCopy that lets you transfer music, photos, and voice memos from old iPods (like the classic ones with hard drives) without using iTunes.


You just plug in your iPod, and the app shows all your music organized by artist and album. You can preview songs, view album art, and export them easily. It also pulls voice memos and photos if you’ve synced those before.


I made it because I couldn’t find a good modern tool that didn’t feel sketchy or super outdated. iCopy is SwiftUI-based, runs natively on modern macOS, and doesn’t do anything weird in the background (no network stuff, no random processes). It’s just a simple, clean utility for anyone still using their iPod — or trying to recover stuff off one.


Here’s a download link if you want to check it out. Happy to answer any questions or feedback.
